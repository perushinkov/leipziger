# Angular Offline Test

## Intro

This offline task was invented to get a picture of your coding skills. Besides coding, we're interested in your ability to implement a given design as well.

Our concept and design for the front-end application are waiting for you on our dedicated Zeplin space[^6]. We're using Zeplin not only for your test, but it's also our collaboration tool of choice when it comes to handover design assets and measurements between multiple teams.

However, if you're not that strong in fancy frontends, keep your focus on the Angular part and make it work.

## Task 1

Create an Angular[^2] application that lists all users and their addresses provided by the users API of JSONPlaceholder[^1].

## Task 2

Add at least one unit test for each of the components that you created using karma[^5].

## Task 3

Add the possibility to view the albums and photos of a selected user.

## Task 4

Add the possibility to create new albums. 
As there is not design available for it, feel free on the implementation details.

## Task 5

Add at least one end-to-end test for your application using protractor[^5].

## Optional

Any pagination, sorting, filtering, and drag-and-drop are a plus.

## Expectations

Document your coding process with Git[^3] and publish your result to the given Gitlab[^4] repository.   We'll clone this repo run your code locally on our machines.
The result in Gitlab should be a git history of your development process (a single commit with the complete application is not acceptable. We want to see multiple commits showing your progress), a README document on how to install and start your application, and a `package.json` with scripts to build and serve your application.
Any styling of your HTML is not necessary. Using AngularJS is not acceptable. Simple is better than complicated. Consider your application a proof-of-concept, quicker development using tools to achieve the result is better than handcrafting every line but taking 5x as long. You can use whatever resources/libraries/open-source also (but not as a replacement) of the libraries previously mentioned. If you can use a CLI that writes 98% of your code, fine! 

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact us[^7].
