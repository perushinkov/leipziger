# AngularTest

## Roadmap
Adding a roadmap to illustrate what I would finish given more time

- Add a couple of more protractor tests (Not too many as protractor tests are not supposed to guarantee app functionality, only that things are wired together okay)
- Add an album editor with add/remove options for pictures. ApiService would need to be extended.
- Make the search users button functional
- Properly tested components (I usually try and go TDD, but seeing how tests are slower to write than functionality, I had to switch into prototyping gear)
- Add a picture preview with a modal pop-up that uses the larger resolution
- Ensure design behaves well on all monitor-size groups
- Make the image paging work a bit more reliable (a few bugs there)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
